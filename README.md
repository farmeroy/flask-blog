# Flask Blog
This is an implementation of the [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/) from the Flask Docs.

This is useful to see the basic structure of a Flask API.

To run the blog, clone the repo and start a virtual environment. Then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
flask run
```
